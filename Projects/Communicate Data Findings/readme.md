## Summary of Findings

> 
#### Univariate Exploration:

    a. 20 to 40 years old people took the more than 70 percent of bike rides. Among all, 30 to 40 years old account for more than 40 percent of all bike rides.
    
    b. Males took around more than 75 percent of all bike rides, and female took around more than 20 percent.
    
    c. Users use this service more on weekdays than weekends. May be they prefer to commute to work by bikes.
    
    d. The peak usage occurs during peak hours (8 to 9 am and 5 to 6 pm). This shows users are commuting to and from office using this service.
    
        
#### Bivariate Exploration:

    a. Subscribers had contributed around 88 percent of the rides where as casual customers had nearly 12 percent.

    b. Number of rides coming from subscribers had grown steadily since June 2017, leaving winter of 2018, where as for casual customers the growth had remained almost flat.

    c. Subscribers' average trip duration is around 11 minutes and customers' average trip duration is around 28 minutes.  

    d. Subscribers and customers trip distance were almost the same, which is around one mile. Therefore based on trip duration and average distance of each user type, we can say that though casual customers had made less number of rides than subscribers they are making longer rides. 

    e. As expected 20 to 40 years old constitute for the majority of rides and growth rate.

    f. Therefore there is a clear difference between both groups in terms of end usage and timing of the usage of bikes. Subscribers use mostly during weekdays that too during peak hours whereas casual customers avail the service during weekends and evening hours of weekdays for may be leisure rides.

    g. 91.9% of rides are non-electric bike rides. Electric bike rides account for just 8.1% of the total rides. Conventional bikes still dominate electric bikes, hopefully the trend reverses as usage of e-bikes picks up.

    h. There was a huge spike at the end of April. After that, it seems the usage trend for electric bikes are decreasing rapidly.

#### Multivariate Exploration:
    
    a. The general trend that subscribers avail the service mostly during peak hours on week days remains same among all three age groups (20 to 30, 30 to 40 and 40 to 50).
    
    b. Older users (40 to 50) tend to ride bikes even during afternoon more often than the younger age groups (20 to 30 and 30 to 40). This may be due to their nature of work (part time or regular).


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Presentation will focus on the influence of age or age group, hour of day and day of week on bike rides. Ensured proper readable and relevant labels, titles, tick marks and legends are present, and consistent representation of different groups with same colors.
